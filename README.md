#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
      Software engineering is a discipline that involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining softwares and it is a discipline because it inv0lves a structured and systematic approach to creating softwares.
      In the world we live in of ever evolving technology newer, better softwares are required to help humnas run their day to day lives easier and faster and efficiently. it is also important in the technology industry because it helps to ensure that softwares are reliable. Taking for example the creation of faster ways of communicating currently due to reliable softwares being created by following the software engineering principle people are able to communicate as fast as they would when physically together but in real sense they are continents apart.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
       Milestone one is the development of programming languages like Fortran C and this was a milestone because it revolutionised the field of software engineering by making programming more accessible, efficient, and powerful. it was like a stepping stone and an opening to the diverse programming languages we have now.
       The second milestone is establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, this milestone achieved alot first it marked the beginning of a more disciplined and systematic approach to software development, which created a gateway to modern practices and methodologies that are essential for creating complex and cutting edge softwares that we enjoy using today
       Another milestone was the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, before 1970s alot of code being written was unstructured hence was not understandable, with the emergence of structured code, most of the code being written was more systematic, manageable, easy to understand and scalable and this led to the modern programming practices we do now.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
       first phase involves gathering system requirements of the problem the software being created will solve, this also involves gathering user needs because they are the ones who will be using the software.
       The second phase is the design phase, nobody wants to use a software that is bad looking and hard to use, thats why this phase is required so as to create softwares that not only look good but are usable. This invloves coming up with the software architecture of the software you are creating.
       Another phase is implementation phase, all that has been planned and designed needs to be transformed into an actual working software hence in this phase code is written and building software based on the design specifications.
       Testing phase is where the software you created is put to the test to see if it actually conforms to user needs and it works as intended, also in this phase checking if the software meets quality standards is done
       Deployment phase is where the software is released for user to start using.
       Maintenance phase is the last phase and its where the software is continually supported, updated, and enhanced based on needs of the user or other requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Comparison
        Both methodoliges require collaboration amongst the team members involved in the creating of the software.
        in both methodologies testing to ensure that the software functions as required is of importance.
        The methodologies start with requirements gathering and understanding the requirements of the project.
    Contrast
        When it comes to flexibility using waterfall makes it hard to incorporate changes once a phase is done while on the other hand agile methodology accomodates changes and new requirements at any stage
        In waterfall methodology when it comes to testing this occurs after the development phase while in agile methodology testing is continuous throughout the development process which is very useful.
    Real life usage of waterfall methodology
         A good example usage of the waterfall methodology is when creating a banking software its usage here is relevant because the bank has well defined requirements based on regulatory compliance, security standards, and existing processes and this methodology has a structures approach that ensure each phase is completed thoroughly and systematically, reducing risks and ensuring a high-quality compliant banking system.
    Real life usage of Agile methodology
         A fine example for this one is mobile food delivery app, here user friendliness is highly dependent on what the user say about the app, and these requirements do change all the time, hence agile methodology is best here, its iterative so changes can happen alot and it's collaborative approach ensures that the mobile app can be developed quickly with continous input from user and stakeholders as these apps are hot cakes.
    

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
         A software developers responsibility is writing code and implementing software solutions that are cutting edge.
         A quality assurance engineer ensures that the software created by the software engineer is of high quality he/she does this by designing and executing test plans.
         A project manager he is the big boss who oversees planning, execution, and delivery of software projects they are famous for setting deadlines.lol.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
          IDEs provide a place for software engineers to write their code, edit it and even point out mistakes in the written code. they also help arrange code in a way that is understandable so that its easy for other developers to read and not these IDEs even come with AI to help one understand code or solve a bug in the code. IDEs also offer collaboration features such as having two developers from different places working on a code at real time and i dont mean pushing code to github so that the other user can see it. An example of such an IDE is VS CODE
          Version Control systems allow multiple developers to work on some code for a long period of time without conflicts and making collaboration seamless. VCS help developers to create branches where they can work on bugs or new features separately without immediatley affecting the main code. examples of VCS is GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
          An example in mobile delivery apps these apps go through alot of changes and all these changes could be a problem as they can delay projects. A way to solve this is by using the agile methodology as it allows for iterative development and it promotes continous collaboration so changes can be handled promptly.
          Some customers require softwares quickly and this introduces tight deadlines which can lead to rushed softwares and compromised quality to solve this prioritze tasks, effectively manage the time you have, collaborate alot having more work force can help reduce the pressure of tight deadlines, utilize tools and technology that help write code faster and effectively and most important focus on quality not perfection
          Another challenge is technical debt which occurs when quick and easy solutions are chosen over well- designed solutions which in the long term brings problems. to avoid this have code reviews so as to identif these technical debts, automate testings, and document what you do.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
           Unit testing invloves testing individual components or unit code, such as functions in isolation maybe for example a method that takes in data and stores it, test it separately. this helps to find bugs early, ensure that functions work okay.
           Integration testing invloves testing individual components to see if they work together perfectly with other components, after testing each component or function alone now we test how each of these components work together with other components. This helps to verify how integrated components work together and if they do so seamlessly and correctly.
           System testing is where the whole system is tested as one to see if it meets with the specified requirements, here the systems functionality is tested and also its performance is checked. This helps to validate if the system meets the specified criteria and behaves as expected.
           Acceptance testing this involves testing the system to determine whether it meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment, here the system is tested if its ready for delivery and it satisfies user's needs. This ensures that the system meets the users' needs and expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
           Prompt engineering is the process of creating questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
           The importance of this is that we give clear instructions to the Ai model, helps to minimize bias, helps to reduce the number of times we need to prompt the AI, one can also have responses given to them as they like, and it can also help to create unique interaction with the AI model almost like human interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
           An example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about programming"
           improved version of the above prompt "Explain the key differences between object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming, with examples"
           The improved prompt is more effective because it asks for a comparison between two programming paradigms and requests examples guiding the AI to provide a focused and informative response.
